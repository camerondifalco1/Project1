# Project1 - Happiness and Life Expectancy

## Description
_Project 1 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

Team: Paula Beckett, Juanita Sands, Joey Zheng, Cameron DiFalco

We are exploring whether happiness impacts life expectancy, and what impacts happiness and life expectancy?

Our analysis is summarised in our powerpoint presentation, titled: DAB Group 3 Powerpoint.

**Research Questions to Answer:**

Which are the happiest countries?
What are some factors that can impact life expectancy?
  - Compare factors against happiness rating:
      - Country Wealth measured predominantly through GDP
      - Health
      - Schooling
      - Social Support
Do those living in happier countries have a higher life expectancy?

The analysis was performed using pandas, matplotlib, hyplot and is outlined further below.
